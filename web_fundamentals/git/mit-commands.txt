At the MIT Terminus site:
http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html

I used cd to move to different locations: cd MIT

I used "less WelcomeLetter" to read the welcome letter that I found at MIT.

I used "cd StatCenter" to move to the StataCenter location inside MIT.

I used "Less HelpfulTA" to read the HelpfulTA document. It read:
Ah, welcome to the wonderful land of Stata. There's one room here that you'll need the combination for. All you 
have to do is ask: 
 'tellme combo'.

I used pwd to remember where I was.
