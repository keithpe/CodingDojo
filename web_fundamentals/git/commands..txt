This is my work from the "Using Terminal Commands" in the Terminal Basics section of the Web Fundamentals GIT section

All of my work for terminal was done on a Mac.

1) Open Terminal. I clicked on the terminal icon. I could also press CMD+SPACE keys and type terminal and press return

2) Navigate to your desktop: 
  
  cd ~/Desktop

3) Create a new directory, call it 'test': 

  mkdir test 

4) Make files called index.html, style.css, commands.txt inside the test directory

  touch test\index.html
  touch test\style.css
  touch test\commands.txt

  or I could move to the test directory first, before creating the new files:

  cd test
  touch index.html
  touch style.css
  touch commands.txt

  Now that I'm in the test subdirectory...

  5) Make a copy of index.html and call it index_2.html

    cp index.html index_2.html

  6) Navigate back to your desktop and make another directory, call it 'destination'.

    cd ..
    mkdir destination
  
  7) Move the index_2.html file to the 'destination' directory.

    mv ./test/index_2.html ./destination

  8) In the 'test' directory remove the'style.css file.

    rm ./test/style.css

  9) Now, check and see what files are in the 'test' and 'desitination' directories.

    index.html,index_2.html and commands.txt are in the ~/Desktop/test directory.
    index_2.html is in ~/Desktop/destination directory

  10) Remove/delete the destination directory.

    rm -rf ~/Desktop/destination

  11) Spend 10 minutes researching some other terminal commands and keep them in mind for the future.

    List open files: lsof
    List oopen files for a specific user: lsof -u user
    Present working directory: pwd
    Browse through a text file: less filename
    Display the first 10 lines of file: head filename
    Display the last 10 lines of file: tail filename
    Show running processes: 
    Kill a process with id of 'id': kill id
    start a program in the background (you get control of the terminal after you start the app)
    program-name &

  12) Here are those commands.

  13) I've include all the commands I've used in this file. (commands.txt).

  14) Dipslay the contents of commands.txt in the terminal:

    cat commands.txt.
