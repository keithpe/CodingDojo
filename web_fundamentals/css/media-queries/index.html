        <h3>Main content</h3>
        <p>According to <span class="book">The Hitchhiker's Guid to the Galaxy</span> by Doulgas Adams, the Answer to
          Life, the universe and everything is 42. Many people look for meaning in the number 42 and although there are
          many interesting things that can be said about it, Dougals Adams said that he only chose it because it sounds
          funny.</p>
