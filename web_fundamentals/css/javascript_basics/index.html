      <h1>Javascript Basics</h1>
      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a
        variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take
        it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node
        server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="topics">Variable Declaration</span> Javaascript variables are containers for storing data
          values - imagine a
          cup you fill
          with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified
          with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="syntax">var x;</span>
        </li>
        <li><span class="topics">Variable Assigment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables -
          our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assigmnent operator
          assigns a value to a variable.
          <span>var x = 10;</span></li>
        <li><span class="topics">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on
          variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -
          <span class="syntax">true</span> or <span class="syntax">false</span> null - <span class="syntax">null</span>
          aka nothing; Number - <span class="syntax">42</span> or <span class="syntax">3.14159</span>; String - <span
            class="syntax">"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span>; Array - <span class="syntax">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']</span>;
          and Object - <span class="syntax">{first_name: 'Jane' ,last_name: 'Doe' ]</span></li>
        <li><span class="topics">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for
          different decisions - hitting
          different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in
          your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="syntax">if</span> a
          specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="syntax">else if</span> to specificy
          a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="syntax">else</span> we execute this
          block of code;</li>
        <li><span class="topics">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but
          they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to
          run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
        <li><span class="topics">Functions</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our
          function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are
          putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we scree the legs
          to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there
          are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
