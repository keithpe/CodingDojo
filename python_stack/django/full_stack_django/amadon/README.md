## Assignment: Amadon

### Objectives:

- Practice handling POST data
- Avoid rendering after a POST request
- Be careful about what you put inside <form>tags

We've decided to start building our own e-commerce site called Amadon.

The goal of this assignment is not to build a full-fledged e-commerce site (i.e. no login, validation, etc.). Rather, we want to point out some important things to consider when building forms:

What we should put in our forms versus what should be handled by the server in the backend
