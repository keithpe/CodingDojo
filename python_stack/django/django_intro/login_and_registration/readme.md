## Assignment: Login and Registration

### Objectives:

- Build a login and registration page with validations
- Practice Flash messages
- Practice session

It's time to build Login and Registration again, this time using Django.

Weâ€™ve learned how to integrate models, validations, and controllers to our projects. Our next goal is to create a fully functional login and registration app! This will combine your knowledge of MVC patterns, validations, and password encryption.

Registration should adhere to the following guidelines:

First Name - required; at least 2 characters; letters only
Last Name - required; at least 2 characters; letters only
Email - required; valid format
Password - required; at least 8 characters; matches password confirmation

**Something to Consider**
**User.objects.get(email = email)**

If there is not a matching email for a .get(), Django throws an error (try and except could come in handy), otherwise it returns the User object associated with the matching user. e.g. Userobject.

**User.objects.filter(email = email)**

Filter, on the other hand, returns a list, so if there is no user that matches, it returns an empty list. If there is a single matching user the list will contain a single User object: e.g. [Userobject].

- [x] Complete each of the following routes:

- [x] Create a new Django project with a login app
- [x] Have the root route render a page where users can register or log in
- [x] Complete the registration method, including showing errors if the input is invalid
- [x] Complete the login method, including showing errors if the input is invalid
- [x] Upon successful registration or login, redirect to a success page, displaying the user's name and a message as shown above
- [x] Have the logout link clear the session and redirect to the login/reg page
- [x] Don't allow a user who is not logged in to reach the /success route (i.e. by making a GET request in the address bar)
- [x] NINJA BONUS: Add a birthday field and validate that the user's birthday is in the past
- [x] NINJA BONUS: Validate that the email provided for registration is unique
- [x] SENSEI BONUS: Add a birthday field and validate that the user is at least 13 years old (COPPA compliant!)
- [ ] SENSEI BONUS: Validate the email uniqueness with AJAX
- [ ] SENSEI BONUS: Use JavaScript to perform client-side validations
- [ ] SENSEI BONUS: In addition to server side validations, use JavaScript to perform client-side validations on required fields. Don't allow the form to be submitted unless fields are valid.
