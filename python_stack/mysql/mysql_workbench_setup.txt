Use MySQLWorkbench to connect to your localhost.

Learn how to use MySQL workbench to do queries directly in the database. To connect to a specific database, runUSE [databasename] in the query box.

Once you're connected a database, try the queries that you would need to make a CRUD application (create, read, update, delete). 
In other words, use the SQL commands INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

Create a text file with the commands you used to query the database. Upload the text file below.

SELECT first_name, last_name from  users WHERE  last_name like "O%";
SELECT concat_ws(' ', first_name, last_name) AS full_name from  users WHERE  last_name like "O%";

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE users SET first_name = 'Donny Boy', last_name='Oberson' WHERE first_name = 'Donny';

DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 6;
