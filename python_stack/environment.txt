Assignment: Practice using pip in a virtual environment

Objectices: 
1) Get used to using commands required to use pip modules.
2) Practice using a virtual environment.

Activate my py3Env environment.
source py3Env/bin/Activate

Run these commands in the order instructed. Include a short explanation of what I was able to learn about 
each command by doing a brief web search for each item. If relevent, include the output of my command and my 
understanding of what it means. Always important to read terminal output and understand it.

use pip when environment is activated (the envirnment will know which version of pyhont/pip is installed).

pip install Django==1.11.9

The output includes status bars and info about what's being installed. The last line displayed when installation is completed is:
Successfully installed Django-1.11.9 pytz-2020.1

pip list

Displays a list of the packages installed in this virtual environment:

Package    Version
---------- -------
Django     1.11.9
pip        20.1
pytz       2020.1
setuptools 41.2.0

To deactivate the virtual environment:
deactivate

New prompt is displayed, without the virtual environment name (py3Env)

pip3 list

Package    Version
---------- -------
asgiref    3.2.7  
pip        20.0.2 
pytz       2020.1 
setuptools 46.0.0 
sqlparse   0.3.1  
wheel      0.34.2 

No Django or Django associated packages that were in my py3Env environment.

source myEnvironments/py3Env/activated
I know see that the py3Env environment name is included in the prompt:
(py3Env) python_stack(master) $: 

pip install Django==1.11.9
Because I already installed Django in this environment, the prompt tells me so:

Requirement already satisfied: Django==1.11.9 in ./my_environments/py3Env/lib/python3.7/site-packages (1.11.9)
Requirement already satisfied: pytz in ./my_environments/py3Env/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from Django==1.11.9) (2020.1)
Could not build wheels for Django, since package 'wheel' is not installed.
Could not build wheels for pytz, since package 'wheel' is not installed.

pip freeze
Output installed packages in requirements format. This listing evidently does not include pip itself or packages that it uses/requirements
to work. Although you can use the "all" flag to show those files as well. The formatting of the output is also the "requirements format".

pip list
Appears to list ALL packages including pip and setuptools (used by pip).

When I call pip freeze > requirements.txt, from the desktop prompt, I see the same list of packages that I saw when I call
pip freeze from the python_stack or myEnvironment directory.

pip uninstall Django

Found existing installation: Django 1.11.9
Uninstalling Django-1.11.9:
